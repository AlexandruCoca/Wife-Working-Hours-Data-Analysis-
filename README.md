# Wife-Working-Hours-Data-Analysis-

 This study was prepared on the last day of the Data Analysis training with a 36-hour R from the 20th academic conference in 2018.
 The information I have learned from this training is a simple work I have prepared.
 
 You can find the dataset and html output of the work in the files. Your expertise in data science may come as a very bad work. 
 
 Because This is my first work  :)
